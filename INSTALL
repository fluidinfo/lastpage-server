To install lastpage, you'll need a modern Python (2.5 is probably ok) and
some supporting modules.

We suggest you make a virtual environment:

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can then run the lastpage server on port 8000 via:

    $ env/bin/twistd -n lastpage --serve-static-files --port 8000

(If you don't want to use virtualenv and pip, you'll need to install the
prerequisites listed in requirements.txt)

If that works, you should be able to visit http://localhost:8000
in your browser and see the same thing you see at http://lastpage.me

In production, you can run lastpage behind nginx, and have nginx serve the
static pages directly. To do this, drop the --serve-static-files from the
above (and the -n if you want logging to go to a file), and adapt the
resources/nginx.conf.sample to your needs.

If you have questions or comments, mail us at info@fluidinfo.com or drop by
the #fluidinfo channel on irc.freenode.net and say hi.
